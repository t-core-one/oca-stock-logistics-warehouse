Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes it is necessary to have pictures of a specific product that is
tracked by serial numbers.

For example you manage a stock of used laptops where each model is a
product variant and each laptop is an item with a unique serial number.
And you would like to have photos of each specific laptop, not just the
pictures of the model from the official website.

However by default in Odoo you can add pictures only to a product
template or a product variant.

Usage
=====

- Go to Inventory > Products > Lots / Serial Numbers and choose a stock
  lot.
- Go to the Images tab. Add a new image or edit the existing ones.
- Refresh the page.
- The first image in the collection is the main image for the stock lot.
